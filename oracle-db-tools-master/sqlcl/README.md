# Scripting

SQLcl scripting is based on Java's [JSR-223](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr223/index.html) which allows scripting languages to be executed from the Java VM.  There are a number of languages that can be plugged in with the NashHorn Javascript engine being included in Java.  A list of languages can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages)
